A simple condition system for Java, without dynamic variables or reflection wizardry.
<p>
  In a nutshell, exception systems deal with exceptional situations by dividing responsibilities in two parts:
  <em>signalling</em> the exception (like <code>throw</code>), and <em>handling</em> it (like <code>try/catch</code>).
  The problem with this setup is, by the time the error reaches the right handler, the context that signalled the
  exception is mostly gone, because the call stack unwinds until the handler is found. This limits the recovery options
  available.
<p>
  A condition system, like the one in Common Lisp, provides a more general solution, by splitting the responsibilities
  in <em>three</em> parts: <em>signalling</em> the condition, <em>handling</em> it, and <em>restarting</em> execution.
  The call stack is unwound only if that was the handling strategy chosen; it doesn't have to be. This enables novel
  recovery strategies and protocols, and can be used for things other than error handling.
<p>
  Therefore, a <em>condition</em> is more general than an exception, representing anything that happened during
  execution and may be of interest to code at different levels on the call stack.
