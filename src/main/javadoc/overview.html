A simple condition system for Java, without dynamic variables or reflection wizardry.
<p>
  Exception systems divide responsibilities in two parts:
  <em>signalling</em> the exception (like <code>throw</code>), and <em>handling</em> it (like <code>try/catch</code>),
  unwinding the call stack until a handler is found. The problem is, by the time the error reaches the right handler,
  the context that signalled the exception is mostly gone. This limits the recovery options available.
<p>
  A condition system, like the one in Common Lisp, provides a more general solution by splitting responsibilities
  in <em>three</em> parts: <em>signalling</em> the condition, <em>handling</em> it, and <em>restarting</em> execution.
  The call stack is unwound only if that was the handling strategy chosen; it doesn't have to be. This enables novel
  recovery strategies and protocols, and can be used for things other than error handling.

  plainly see; I hope he doesn't mind :), terminology and tests.
